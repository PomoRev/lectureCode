Welcome to Week 9

Note: this file will be augmented after the class.

1. USER/GROUP MANAGEMENT COMMANDS

adduser - adds a user with a script to capture all that juicy data

useradd - barebones, you need to set the switches for things like 
creating the user's home directory (-m), etc.

su  - switch user

su -  - switch user initialize their environment, including starting
in the new user's home folder.

whoami - returns the login for the current user. You can also
extract a user's name from the passwd file. 

chgrp - change the group ownership of a file (similar to chown and 
chmod)

newgrp - switches the current group of the current user, this 
allows them to create and manage files which have the new
group's ownership. This is for collaboration purposes. You leave 
the new group with the exit command.

groupadd - adds a new group to the system.

id - displays the current user's group (good to confirm you are 
doing your work from the correct group). 


2. UNIX SHELL ENVIRONMENT 

alias - lists all of the currently set aliases. The shell will 
do a direct replacement of any alias for the aliased data unless
you quote it. 

alias [name]=[replacement text]  - sets a new alias, note the
spacing. The rule of thumb is that if there is no space in an 
attribute it is a single attribute, otherwise spaces delimit
parameters in a command line.

Because an alias is directly replaced with the replacement text 
it can be combined with other attributes and commands.

unalias [alias name] - removes an alias from your environment. 
Aliases also die with your session, so if you close your bash 
shell you will lose any aliases you set from the command line.

env - displayes the environment variables

$PATH

export

export -f 


sudo snap install code --classic    type exact to install VSCode in Linux and your life will be much better.
